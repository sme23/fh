// repoint chapter table in a way that messes with automatic detection in editors

// pointers @:
// $3462C
// $B5E68
// $B5F98
// $B61C0
// $B6328
// $B6500
// only the first one is used but the rest are referenced regardless
// rather than pointing them to 0, we point them to a fake copy of the chapter table 
// the function in which the first pointer is referenced we hook that part of and load it as an EA literal in a new function placed in free space
