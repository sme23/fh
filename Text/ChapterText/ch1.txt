[OpenMidLeft][LoadGreenSoldier]
Halt! Who goes there?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I am Prince Dominic of Esnia.[A][N]
I must speak with King Rombus[N]
of Udrein. Is he available?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
His Highness is currently preoccupied,[N]
but he should be available shortly.[A][N]
You can wait inside. Please, follow me.[A][X]

## Ch1OpeningText2
[OpenMidRight][LoadDominic]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadGreenSoldier]
You and your companions[N]
can wait in this room.[A][N]
We will let you know when[N]
His Highness is available.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
All right, thank you.[A][X]

## Ch1OpeningText3
[OpenMidRight][LoadDominic]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadRay]
[OpenLeft][LoadElliot]
We must locate the[N]
temple on the premises.[A][N]
Is everyone versed on the plan?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I'll keep King Rombus busy.[N]
Ray, duck in that room there.[A][N]
Once I've left for my audience,[N]
find your way behind the throne room.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
Sure thing, boss.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
The rest of you, search[N]
the front of the building.[A][N]
You're much less[Beat] covert,[A][N]
so try to stay out of the areas[N]
you're not supposed to be in.[A]
[OpenLeft]
Of course, Milord.[A][N]
But I must insist, are you[N]
sure this is a good idea?[A][N]
If you are caught, the consequences[N]
would be most dire[Beat][A]
[OpenMidRight]
We don't have a choice, Elliot.[A][N]
If the rumors are true,[A][N]
we cannot allow the resurrection[N]
of the Goddess Carthena.[A][N]
There is no risk too high.[A][X]

## Ch1OpeningText4
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDominic]
[OpenMidRight][LoadGreenSoldier]
Milord, His Majesty is[N]
able to see you now.[A][N]
Please, follow me.[A][X]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadKing]
Well, if it isn't young Dominic.[A][N]
What can I do for you today?[A][X]


## Ch1Talk_Repeat
[OpenMidRight][LoadDominic]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadKing]
Come now, we've already discussed this.[A][X]


## Ch1Talk_KingdomState
[OpenMidLeft][LoadKing]
[OpenMidRight][LoadDominic]
So, how fares your kingdom these days?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Quite prosperous![A][N]
We have had a bumper crop this year,[N]
and are quite set through the winter[A][N]
with enough to spare[N]
for significant trade.[A][X]

## Ch1Talk_ForeignRelations
[OpenMidLeft][LoadKing]
[OpenMidRight][LoadDominic]
As you know, the relationship[N]
between our two countries[A][N]
has historically been quite strong.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Yes, I do know. Is there something[N]
you'd like to say about it?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
P-perhaps not[Beat][A][X]

## Ch1Talk_TradeDispute
[OpenMidLeft][LoadKing]
[OpenMidRight][LoadDominic]
There have recently been disputes[N]
over the taxation of trade routes[A][N]
between our two kingdoms.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Yes, I'm quite aware of that.[A][N]
If that is what this visit is about,[A][N]
I currently have negotiators[N]
on their way to your kingdom.[A][N]
They will resolve this[N]
issue in my stead.[A][X]

## Ch1Talk_Weather

Is that a new cape?[A][N]
Its royal red looks[N]
quite dashing![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
[Beat][A][X]

## Ch1Talk_Conclusion
[OpenMidRight][LoadDominic]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadKing]
Well, I suppose that's quite[N]
enough discussion for today.[A][N]
If you do not have a more[N]
pressing matter to discuss,[A][N]
you should be on your way.[A][N]
I am a very busy man, after all.[A][X]

## Ch1Talk_Conclusion2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadGreenSoldier]
[OpenMidRight][LoadKing]
This visit was not random.[A][N]
Secure the "event area",[A][N]
and keep an eye out for[N]
any suspicious individuals.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Sir![A][X]

## Ch1Talk_Bathroom
[OpenMidLeft][LoadGreenSoldier]
[OpenMidRight][LoadCurrent]
Sorry to bother, but can you[N]
show me to a bathroom, please?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Of course! Follow me.[A][X]

## Ch1ScoldText
[OpenMidLeft][LoadGreenSoldier]
Hey, you're not supposed[N]
to be in here![A][X]

## Ch1EndingText1
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent]
Looks like this is the way forward.[N]
Best to call everyone else over.[A][X]

## Ch1EndingText2
[OpenFarLeft][LoadLydia]
[OpenLeft][LoadElliot]
[OpenMidRight][LoadDominic]
Looks like both staircases[N]
lead to the same place.[A][N]
[OpenLeft]
I can feel an ominous[N]
presence ahead[Beat][A][N]
Please, do be careful.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Of course.[A][N]
Let's go.[A][X]
