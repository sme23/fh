[OpenMidLeft][LoadElliot]
[OpenMidRight][LoadDominic]
We're almost out of here.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Something's wrong.[A][N]
It's too quiet[Beat][A][X]


## Ch3OpeningText2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDominic]
[OpenMidRight][LoadKing]
Quite right, you are.[A][N]
Well, if it isn't King Esnia's whelp.[N]
Doing a bit of espionage, are we?[A][N]
That's a serious crime, you know.[A][N]
Guards! Restrain them![A][X]

## Ch3OpeningText3
[OpenMidRight][LoadDominic]
We're going to have[N]
to fight our way out.[A][N]
Everyone, get ready![A][X]


## Ch3EndingText1
[OpenMidLeft][LoadElliot]
[OpenMidRight][LoadDominic]
Looks like we've lost them.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
We're lucky to have made[N]
it out in one piece.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
The mission was a[N]
success, though.[A][N]
The world is safe[N]
for another day.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
But at what cost?[A][N]
The diplomatic fallout of this[N]
alone is quite the predicament.[A][N]
Your father will not be[N]
pleased to hear of this.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
That's a problem to solve[N]
once we return home.[A][N]
For now, we should make[N]
camp here for the night.[A][X]

...[.....][A][X]

## Ch3EndingText2_2
[ToggleRed]Yawn...[N]
I've slept for so long.[A][ToggleRed][X]

## Ch3EndingText2_3
Who's there!?[A][X]

## Ch3EndingText2_4
[ToggleRed]I'm sure you can figure it out, mortal.[A][ToggleRed][X]

## Ch3EndingText2_5
...[....]![.....] No, it can't be![A][N]
We stopped them from reviving Carthena.[N]
There's no way you could be here now![A][X]

## Ch3EndingText2_6
[ToggleRed]Reviving me? Silly boy, they[N]
were never trying to do that.[A][N]
They were simply giving me a vessel[N]
through which to revive myself.[A][N]
A puppet, to follow my every command.[A][N]
And I must say, they made[N]
an excellent decision,[A][N]
choosing you for the job.[A][N]
The prince of the land responsible[N]
for my destruction? How ironic![A][ToggleRed][X]

## Ch3EndingText2_7
...[A][N]
.....[A][X]

## Ch3EndingText2_8
[ToggleRed]Is the reality of your[N]
situation finally setting in?[A][N]
You were drawn here on[N]
purpose by my disciples.[A][N]
You[.....] were always the[N]
target of their ritual.[A][N]
This was their plan all along,[A][N]
and you fell for it,[N]
hook,[......] line,[......] and sinker.[......][A][ToggleRed][X]

## Ch3EndingText2_9
No...[......]No![....][A][X]

## Ch3EndingText2_10
[ToggleRed]Now, let me make the specifics[N]
of your predicament very clear.[A][N]
You will[.....] do as I command.[A][N]
You will not[.....] inform anyone[N]
of my presence within you.[A][N]
If you defy me,[A][N]
I will inflict upon you[N]
unimaginable torture.[A][N]
And don't think offing[N]
yourself will do any good.[A][N]
You'll simply free my spirit,[N]
and I'll inhabit someone else.[A][N]
That king of father[N]
you have, perhaps...?[A][N]
Do I make myself clear?[A][ToggleRed][X]

## Ch3EndingText2_11
...[A][N]
Yes...[A][N]
Yes, I understand.[A][X]

## Ch3EndingText2_12
[ToggleRed]Good.[A][N]
Now, rest up.[A][N]
We have a very busy day tomorrow...[......][A][ToggleRed][X]
