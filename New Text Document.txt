4 (5? some number of) dragons acting as guardians of fundamental aspects of the world / seals on some undesireable evil force

number of nations roughly equal to number of dragons, give or take one or two for flavor reasons

one nation taken control of by obligatory evil cult, aiming to eliminate the dragons to release the seal on their evil worship object (secret additional dark dragon)

they will ultimately succeed, but by the time that they do the lord will be sufficiently strong to fight against it

they dont actually kill all the dragons, one or more will survive and willingly abdigate their seal rather than die to protect it

doruagon types largely following archanea ones

Fire, Earth, Mage, Divine, Ice, Water, Wind
Fire, Water, Earth, Wind, Light, Dark
->
Fire, Ice, Earth, Mage, Divine, Dark
that's 6 including the sekrit one so that works
'wyvern' as a beeg dragon doesnt quite work so there'll be something involving wyverns & wind related to mage dragon
 
well some of these are easy

nation of mages where mage dragon lives, holy nation where divine dragon lives, dark dragon tied to evil clan
ice dragon in a snowy land, fire dragon in a hot land (Desert? Volcano? Both?), so earth is left for the temperate areas
mage & divine can also be in temperate areas, Earth prolly lives in a cave
ice & fire dragons are in remote locations that are difficult to reach so rather than immediately marching an army all the way out to each they start based on proximity
let's say, 5 nations total + some other things
remote tribes in ice region not as a nation, desert nation that incidentally is near fire dragon but doesnt worship it or anything, those are ez
mage nation is directly led by mage dragon, holy nation worships divine dragon which resides within it as an important figure
2 nations in general temperate area, neither particularly reverent of earth dragon but generally aware of it living nearby; one of these is where evil clan takes control through spooky magicks
lord to start as wandering traveler with one or more companions, stumbling across the earth dragon and recieving blessing + call to action + etc shortly before evil army enters and mysterious hooded figure kills dragon but not before it successfully whisks away our heroes from danger 
thus, heroes set off to meet the other dragons, every time narrowly missing to save them, or saving them temporarily but they choose to release their seal once they learn what's going on as they value their life more (mage & divine would do this, fire & ice would not)
seal of the wyverns - final, lost seal, as there is no dragon tied to it, tied to a remote mountainous temple that must be rediscovered; also where dark dragon gets revived and fought at in endgame
ok now we need names :midblink:
